# Code quality

The first goal is to create an object oriented wrapper that is maintainable,
fully documented and easy to use.

The code quality is tested and validated with:
- pylint (Python checker)
- pyflakes (Python checker)
- mccabe (code complexity)
- coverage.py (coverage of the unit-tests)

My goal is to write a source code that is 100% covered with unit-tests and
fully compatible with Python's standards and good practices.
